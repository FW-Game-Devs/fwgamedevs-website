        On May 9th, 2026, we'll be hosting our first Video Game Showcase where we'll be highlighting
        local and regional indie games for the Fort Wayne public to play.
        <br><br>
        If you'd like to submit your game to be considered for the showcase,
        check back here on February 23rd for a form link. We're looking for playable games (full, demo, or vertical slice)
        from Indiana or the Midwest region of the US. If you're a developer who's excited to show their game to an eager audience
        and meet other developers in the region, we'd love to see your submission!
