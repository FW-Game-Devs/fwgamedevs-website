        On May 9th, 2026, we'll be hosting our first Video Game Showcase at The Forum | Electric Works Campus where we'll be highlighting
        local and regional indie games for the Fort Wayne public to play.

        If you'd like to submit your game to be considered for the showcase,
        check back here on February 23rd for a form link. We're looking for playable games (full, demo, or vertical slice)
        from Indiana or the Midwest region of the US. If you're a developer who's excited to show their game to an eager audience
        and meet other developers in the region, we'd love to see your submission!
